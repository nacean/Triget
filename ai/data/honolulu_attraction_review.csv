Unfortunately, there was no wind but the owner called and offered to switch us out to a kayak trip if the wind did not come up by the time we arrived.   No wind-  but it did not matter because we had a fabulous experience with our guide  Kevin-  who towed us out to the reef and guided us around with the kayak.  He taught us about the reef and explained how the reef was formed where we should look safely look for fish and turtles.  I am a very cautious snorkeler and he could not have been nicer to me and more helpful and encouraging.  We were lucky with a very calm bay and witnessed hundreds of fish and five turtles.  We learned about the good work this non-profit does for the community and the bay.    We returned to a healthy lunch with a vegetarian option (we advised them ahead of time). I highly recommend this company not only for the tour and our delightful guide, but how easy they were about everything and this is a company that cares so much about the environment.

The hike itself is not very difficult but there are a lot of stairs, so people with mobility issues should abstain.  There isn’t much shade so it gets very hot. Be sure to bring lots of water. It is very crowded at the top platforms which can hold about 20 or 30 people so definitely no social distancing there.  Highly recommend a visit!",Diamond Head Crater Hike
19735637,"Excellent views - not very difficult hike I hiked the crater with my son. I am 61 and he is 37. We both found it easier than we expected - though we took the easier path instead of the seemingly never-ending steps towards the top of the hike. We took the bus (No.2) from central Waikiki at 7.15am, arriving at the Diamond Head State Monument bus stop c7.30am. It was important to us to try the hike early in the morning to try to avoid the crowds and the heat later in the day. We avoided the heat but even at 7.30am there were very few car parking spaces (making us glad that we had taken the bus) indicating that it was already busy. Its $5 each (without a car) and off you go. The path is smooth initially then it’s quite rough so needs attention as you climb. The ascent took us about 35 minutes with several sight-seeing stops and without rushing. The view from the top is amazing. The sea, volcanic rock, mountains, greenery and especially the view of Waikiki is well worth the effort. Going down can be tricky due to the rough path and the fact that others are coming up (it’s just one path going up and down - and it’s narrow). We walked back to our hotel in central Waikiki in about 40 minutes from the end of the hike. We didn’t stop at the food vans because they were pretty busy. Well worth doing.",Diamond Head Crater Hike

Matt is now the owner and lead instructor who conducts introductory beginner class and also holds regular workout classes on SUP, 7 times a week. PCF is the only licensed SUP operator at Ala Moana Beach park. While it seems easy to get started on SUP, proper technique, safety, knowledge of paddle and board types are key.

5859033,"My First Bonefish on a Fly! Was on a short visit to Oahu to see my daughter and carved out some time on Father's Day to do a 1/2 day fishing outing. If it wasn't such a short visit I would have done a full day. But even with just a half day, the trip couldn't have been better. We launched out of the Keehi Small boat harbor and didn't waste anytime, making a quick run to a large nearby flat. Jesse got us to the right spots on the flats, wasn't long before he was seeing fish and gave me good directions so I could get my eyes on them, too. I got ample shots at lots of fish, had two hooks ups. Landed one and the other cut me off on some coral after making a screaming long run. That's fishing. I probably could have gotten more if my casting was a little better. With Jesse's great help and direction you don't necessarily need to be an expert fly fisherman to have a successful day.  Jesse is very knowledgeable and experienced. He is very personable and I enjoyed talking fishing while we scanned for bones. Also his boat is in great shape and well rigged for bonefishing.Getting my first bonefish on a fly was an awesome experience and helped make for a great Father's Day.

It is open to military and DoD personnel and those who are a part of a tour group. On the island are several naval facilities, the Navy Inn, military housing, Nob Hill, Luke Field, and Hospital Point. It also has four main groups of military housing: Nob Hill, Luke Field, and Battleship Cove.  Ancient Hawaiians used this place for a fertility ritual.

As you walk down the paved pathway, take note of the sea cliffs and narrow beach.  While the beach is not a good place to swim because it is rocky, it is an ideal place for surfers to enjoy the waves in a less crowded space.  There was a steady stream of men and women heading down with their surfboards. It was fun watching them surf. You can also enjoy a view of the lighthouse as you descend the pathway.  It will be on the right side.  Depending on the number of surfers, that is usually plenty of parking in the pullouts.",Diamond Head Beach Park

10270624,"Best lessons on the island! I had taken a few lessons on the island before but Polu Lani was the first time I felt really coached and comfortable surfing. John is one of the nicest, most aloha dudes I’ve met- made me feel safe, gave me constructive critiques, and helped me feel like I improved in just one session. I could not recommend Polu Lani surf school more, my only regret is that I didn’t find them sooner. Very excited to take what I learn here out on the water!!",Polu Lani Surf Lessons & Adventures
10270624,Awesome experience Great experience with John. It was mine and my 17 year old daughter’s first time surfing. She got up the first time and every time after that! It took me a couple times. John’s instruction made it easy and we loved surfing. The waves were perfect for beginners. It was one of the big highlights of our trip.,Polu Lani Surf Lessons & Adventures
10270624,Great experience! Would totally come back! Great experience! John is very knowledgeable and patient. Both myself and 17 year old daughter got up on the first try. It was everything you'd hope your first surfing experience would be; safe and fun!Had a few questions before booking and John was easy to reach and quick to reply. Got a late start on the day of the lesson but John totally made up for it with an epic video of my daughter surfing and taking her out again with the next lesson.  The meet up area is easy to find and parking is pretty easy and free.I highly recommend John and his company. He'll get you up surfing guaranteed.,Polu Lani Surf Lessons & Adventures

I was able to see and view unforgettable peaks and valleys of Oahu. All the more, Nandor is just a great guy. He’s a pleasure to spend a day with. I can’t recommend Nandor enough.

However, Hawaii’s public beach access law makes it illegal to prohibit beach access.  When you arrive at the gate, simply tell the guard you are going to the beach.  The guard checks your driver’s license and makes note of your license plate number and then you can enjoy Kapilina Beach.  The sand is full of pebbles and the sunset we saw was just okay. Dogs are allowed on this beach.  There was live music and a food venue called D’Lish at the Beach (food was lousy). There are picnic tables with shades scattered throughout.  Only residents are allowed to use the sunshades on the beach itself.  However, restrooms and showers are available to all.

To see the auction, the only one from Maine to Japan, with buyers from local restaurants and as far away as Japan was exciting!  Samples of the fish were available for buyers to feel.  It wasn't clear what the buyers were looking for but two identical fish could sell for a big difference.  The guys wished they could have or buy the cut samples but for hygenic reasons they were tossed out.  One of his friends, an avid Alaskan fisherman, thought this was the highlight of his trip!

I made a jet ski reservation last month for my family of 5 while we were on vacation.  We were charged for the service upfront so it was a lot of money  that we had to pay.  Unfortunately, due to some unexpected issues on the day of the appointment, we were late for the appointment.  I was told that the entire day was all booked up so we could not reschedule. While I was still in Oahu, I texted and also left a voicemail for Darren; asking if I can get a credit to use in the future.  I did not receive a response back.  When I returned home, I attempted to reach out again with an email explaining what happened on the day, with the details of the issues that I ran into.   Again, I waited and never heard back.

1873443,"Pleasant morning Drive through a long way of residential area wondering how you could possibly arrive at a natural destination worthy of a 5 mile hike in nature when viola! You arrive at a very pretty park that feels like you are miles away from civilization.  The most important note (at least to me) is that you don't want to park at the first few parking lots if your destination is the loop trail.  Drive in, past a few parking lots, past the camprground, up a steep hill where you will see a restroom building, parking and a sign for the loop trail.  The road is one way so don't also accidentally pass the last area of parking and have to come around again :)   We arrived pretty early after the park opened, by the time we returned from our hike the parking area was quite full so you might want to plan accordingly.  The hike is pretty easy as it follows a ridge line and is shady for most of it.  There is a slight incline or decline depnding on direction but quite manageable.  If you go the direction starting behind the restroom building and where the plaque explaining the WWII plan that crashed here, you will have a steep portion to come up at the end but it only takes maybe 10 minutes.Lots of places to stop for views, but additionally, it's a just nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the island.  There are plenty of picnic areas so you could certainly extend your stay at the park.It was dry while we were there but for sure if it is wet or raining this trail could be treacherous (as one reveiwer noted, but that's not a reflection of the trail, just luck).  Good sneakers or hiking shoes will work otherwise, although we did see some in various sandals.  I think I'd recomend going the reverse direction.  Start on the steep portion which you will pass first a little ways down the hill form the sign and restroom at top.  As I recall the trail came out in a camping area near a different restroom you can see from the road.  This will allow you to descend the steepest portion and also descend a little on the last leg.

It is a habit I myself am trying to set.This is our second time using this service, the first time a couple years ago. This is a great service if you’re on Waikiki and don’t readily have transportation to/from Pearl Harbor. The first time we took this tour, we were a little leery, but the second time was like “old hat.” We were especially happy with our driver, Tom. He had a great since of humor and very knowledgeable. We opted to spend the entire day and Pearl Harbor and purchased the Complete Pearl Harbor Experience. Which was a lot! The one plus to this service is that you have transportation handled, and they take care of all of the logistics around getting your tickets to the things in your package. Once you arrive at Pearl Harbor, they assist with orienting you to the site and then get your tickets and give you any instructions and tips you might need. Tom gave us a great tour of the city, including some of the tremendous art and the Punch Bowl. One recommendation is that they add an option to get out at the punch bowl for 10-15 minutes rather than driving through. Maybe I’m in the minority, but paying one’s respects here might be nice.A couple things to note to first timers: -This is not a fully guided tour. They are there for orient you and get you going. If you want a guided tour (with a person, not a headset), you may need to take a couple more steps. -This tour doesn’t include your headset for the main museum site. You’ll need to purchase this separately for a nominal cost.-If you do the Bowfin, the tour will include a headset for this tour. The are not the same.-Be respectful. Watching folks around me for a second trip to Pearl Harbor, I think people may be disrespectful and not realize it. If the Memorial is open, remove your hats and be respectful and quiet from the time you step off the boat until you get back on. If the Memorial isn’t open, remove your hats and bow your head when passing. If respecting this space and getting a few less photos is the cost, then so be it. This is holy ground. -Spend the extra few bucks and go out to the Missouri. There is nothing like standing looking out from her over the harbor, and to stand where WWII ended. It’s worth it.-No, you can’t bring food and drinks with you on the bus.-No, you can’t bring bags. All of the notes and warnings about this aren’t being hyperbolic. They mean it! No bags means no bags. There is minimal storage outside the gates, but unless you have a medical condition, leave them at your hotel. The guards at PH aren’t necessarily nice about enforcing this rule. -Tip your driver!Finally, a shout out to the booking agent who helped me change the date when I accidentally booked the wrong date online.

The lighthouse is visible from the street but no public access. Wear good walking shoes as the path towards Diamond Head is a little rocky.#DiamondHeadLighthouse#DiamondHeadCrater",Diamond Head Lighthouse
13358083,"Closed to the Public The Diamond Head Lighthouse is located on Diamond Head Road that encircles Diamond Head.  The lighthouse is not open to the public but is easily visible from both Diamond Head Road and near the Kuilei Cliffs Beach Park.  The white concrete structure stands 55-feet tall and has a red roof.  Originally built in 1899 and rebuilt in 1917 due to cracks, the place serves as the home for the commander of the 14th coast guard district. I did some research and found that large bonfires were used to guide mariners ashore.  Lighthouses were built on Oahu after shipwreck of two large ships in the 1800’s. The red light was visible for 17 nautical miles from the shoreline.",Diamond Head Lighthouse

But overall the price for this experience should be reduced compared to what you have to pay for other places to visit at Pearl Harbor.",Ford Island Control Tower
17642016,Great looking statue... ...that sits outside the Kaneohe Courthouse.  It's a permanent exhibit that is part of a state sponsored art in public places series.  The statue has two fishermen - one holding a baby and one holding a paddle - that represent the the prosecution and defense in the judicial system according to what I read.  It's a pretty awesome looking statue in a kind of residential neighborhood and worth a look if you're in the area.,Mamalahoe Statue
15027272,Leads to the Kulana’Ahane Trail  This trail is really nothing special however at the end of the trail is the start of the Kulana’ahane trail which is amazing!! The Moanalua Valley Trail is mostly flat and ventures through tropical forest but kind of stops in the middle of nothing.,Moanalua Valley Trail
15027272,"Moanalua Valley Trail My wife and I ventured out for this hike from the Hilton Beach Resort in Waikiki. We used the city bus to get to the trail. Once we arrived, we began our hike, with the final destination being the water falls. Jumping off a water fall into a body of water was on my wife’s bucket list of things to do. The trail out to the waterfall was not an easy hike. The trail was muddy, uneven, with lots of different elevation. Once you arrive close to the falls, be prepared to get your shoes wet & dirty. You definitely need to wear some type of footwear, because the stream is very rocky. The climb up to the falls is not that difficult but the rocks are wet & very slippery. The water is very cold and refreshing. Bug spray would be a good thing to have with you and drinking water to keep hydrated. I would recommend this hike for people who are use to taking vigorous hikes. You will be well rewarded. For first time hikers, you can do this but know it’s difficult. Mahalo 🤙",Moanalua Valley Trail

15555890,"We were not fans We did not have a great experience here. When we arrived as a group we all intended to shoot. But after watching the safety video and finding out we were pretty much left to our own devices, a few of us opted out. Instead of being offered a bit of assistance or anything, those that opted out were basically told we were wasting there time and we might as well just shoot if we are there. We told them we weren't comfortable being left with a firearm as we don't normally shoot and would prefer to watch - the staff did not seem impressed at all. The few that have been around firearms and proceeded to hire weapons, did not have the smoothest run. Not only did 2 of the 3 weapons continually jam and need staff to fix them (that gave those watching even more reason to stand by their decision to sit out) they found themselves wanting to not use the entire box of ammo, which apparently isn't an option either. All in all, not a great experience and we don't plan on going back here.",Xring Security and Firearms
15555890,"Awesome shooting range with helpful and friendly staff! X-Ring Security is an excellent place to shoot. Whether you’re brand new to shooting (like myself) or a seasoned marksman, you will have a great time here. There is a wide assortment of rental guns or you can bring your own.The staff it what makes X-Ring special. They are so genuinely friendly and helpful. They all try to assist with your technique and give lots of praise. It’s a little off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trip. Highly recommended!",Xring Security and Firearms
15555890,"Excellent range - don’t go anywhere else on Oahu!  Visited the range today and it was absolutely outstanding! Being from Australia we are restricted in options and this is perfect to get out and experience firearms if you haven’t in safe but fun environment. The range is next to brand new and is great. There is plenty of selection for rental firearms, from .22 pistols right up to the classic Desert Eagle.The staff were excellent and friendly, and the prices are great. Don’t bother going anywhere else, compared to ranges in Waikiki, Xring is 30 times more value for money.It is a drive from Waikiki but it is well worth it, and you will get value for money as well as a great time! Would highly recommend to anyone!",Xring Security and Firearms

105445,LOVED this opportunity!!! Last year we visited Pearl Harbor and this year we wanted to get over to the Missouri. I found a wonderful opportunity to give back all while being able to see this incredible vessel.

23475283,"Onlineeinkauf in Honolulu auf Hawaii Ich habe im Internet nach einer Möglichkeit gesucht Sachen wie z.B. Macadamianüsse direkt in Hawaii einkaufen zu können. Dadurch kam ich auf die Seite von ""The Hawaii Shop"" . Dort fand ich diese Nüsse und bestellte sie mit Standardpaket. Man muss im voraus bezahlen. Zwischendurch nahm ich über die mail-Adresse Kontakt mit dem Geschäft auf, um zu fragen, wie lange die Lieferung dauert. Sie können deutsch und nach 5 Wochen kam heute das Päckchen an. Ausgeliefert wurde es durch die Postbotin, die auch gleich die Zollgebühr von ca. 5,00 € bei einem Warenwert von ca. 100,00 € kassiert.Wenn jemand Hawaii mag und auch Dinge von dort, da kann ich diesen Onlinehandel sehr empfehlen. Ich werde ganz bestimmt wieder dort einkaufen, sollte ich nicht persönlich nach Hawaii kommen.",The Hawaii Shop
7914964,"Hawaii, Monster! World Class Bonefish My wife and I planned a vacation to Hawaii to celebrate our 60th birthdays this year. 1 week on Oahu and another on the Big Island where we have a time share. Well it was time to see if there was something in Hawaii to check off my bucket list. As usual, I started researching the fishing opportunities available. Last time to the islands we did some deep sea fishing with success. Caught Mahi Mahi. Over the last couple years I have determined my true love for fishing is light tackle in-shore type such as for Red Fish, Snook, Tarpon etc. In my initial investigation I noticed article after article talking about 10 lb plus Bone Fish were a common reality in Hawaii and really that was the first time I have heard that. Usually when you talk Bones it's the Bahamas, Belize and the Keys. Since I have caught a number of tackle busting small Bonefish in Belize 3 lbs or so, I could only imagine what a 10 pounder would do! So I quickly looked up a couple guides on Oahu. I ended up booking with Captain Rick Lee from www.bonefishhawaii.com. I have to tell you that was one of the best decisions of my fishing life. I don't fly fish and Rick had no problem accommodating me using spinning gear and bonefish jigs. As we went out Rick seemed kinda excited about the spinning prospects since a lot of these bones get used to looking at flies most of the time. My wife joined us to enjoy the Hawaiian scenery from the waters perspective. After a quick run across the bay it wasn't long and Captain Rick was up on his platform looking down the flat and yelling Bone at 11 o’clock, 60 feet. My knees were knocking, casted the jig, the Bonefish rushed up and rejected the offering. Well this went on for a few more times and I was getting frustrated with the way my gear was casting these light weight jigs so Rick set up one of his rigs for me and it performed much better. That's when it finally happened!, Rick yelled Big Fish 10 o’clock cast 80 feet and reel so I can see the jig on top. I did what he said, I cast to 80 feet lifted my tip Rick said Reel!, Reel!, Reel!, and Stop. Soon as I stopped Rick yelled he's on it!, That's when the line went taught and the reel started screaming! Line just kept on stripping from the reel, I was carefully tightening down on the drag to try to slow this beast, after a 200 yard initial run and several other 100 yard runs the fish was at the side of the boat. A true 10 lb, beautiful, silver sided, with broad greenish shoulders Bonefish. My wife looked at me and said I have never seen you this excited to catch a fish, and I was. A long with that bone I had chances for others but missed but Captain Rick was excited to put me on another beautiful specimen a Golden Trevally which was a riot to catch it was also about 10lbs. Cool Fish. I can't say enough about Captain Rick, He was awesome and if you are a weekend fisherman or a pro you need to look Captain Rick up before you get to Oahu.Best Guide and Best investment in a guide I have ever made. Thanks Rickwww.bonefishhawaii.com",Bonefish Hawaii

14187273,Mermaid snorkel My kids had fun but they barely snorkeled they had to wait because they were still busy with the group before us then the camera ran out of batteries and then were cut short don’t know why time was not up yet.  I knew when we started that their tails were to small but the lady insisted that they were the right size.  Now when they try to wear them they are constantly pulling them up cause they fall up the thread is stretched out and they have only had them for a few weeks.  And for the price they should last longer.  Most of the video taken of them swimming underwater during this experience was of the lady’s legs who was taking the photos.  Hardly any of them.  Do not recommend this experience.  Find something else or buy the find yourself then you can get the right size without the worker saying no that is to big.  The smaller sizes do not fit good.,Mermaid Republic
14187273,Awesome ...  It was very fun and I learned a lot about marine life and I strongly recommend going.  From Annie. Alberto was very generous with his time. Recommend if you are accompanying someone but not doing the experience yourself take your swimmers as it’s a lovely lagoon and pretty hot on the beach!!!,Mermaid Republic

8444737,"The ""Unprepared"" Accidental Hikers We were looking for a ""good"" hike to do. My daughter wanted to hike from the Hilton Hawaiian Village up to the top of Diamond Head. Nice, but a little vanilla. I challenged her to do something a little more challenging. We agreed on the Pali Puka Hike. Problem was we got confused with directions and ended up at the parking lot for the start of the Moanalua Valley Trail Hike. This hike is the ""legal"" way to gain access to the Stairway to Heaven (Otherwise know as the Haiku Stairs).We thought that the hike we were attempting (Paki Palu) was an easy 2.2 miles out and 2.2 miles back.  WRONG. We were there, so not realizing what lay before us, we started the hike. Very little water, no food, a little candy, cameras and fortunately GOOD hiking boots. (Note - If you do this trail, the whole thing is 10-12 miles in length, start no later than 0830 am, have plenty of water, food, good boots and gloves for climbing the last sections). The first 2.8 miles is a nice little hike, ANYONE can do it. At the 2.8 mile point you come to a fork in the road, go LEFT. Do NOT go right like we did initially. We went 30 minutes the wrong way, had to double back, this ate up a lot of our daylight.Once back at the sign, we went left and immediately all hell breaks loose. The entire climb ascends some 2,600', most of it after the split at 2.8 miles. If it's muddy, it's really tough. Intermittent cloud cover, and rain makes its even more challenging. Since we started out so late, we did not see any other people until we were well into the hike and they were returning. Most being successful, a few tapped out at the rope sections. Every single group however started that from whatever point we met them at, it got a lot steeper from that point on. And it did. It is ABSOLUTELY CRAZY, but exhilarating. People have died on this trail. A lot of the time you have 1.000' vertical drops on both the left and the right of you and the path is only 2' wide. If you don't like heights, don't do this hike.Up and up and up we went. our pace slowed dramatically as a result and with 0.9 miles to go, while not having reached any of the most challenging rope sections, my daughter (27), wife (55) and myself (60), decided that we did not have enough daylight left to complete the hike and return down the mountain safely (like it was even safe in the first place). We turned back.Phenomenally beautiful photos. Absolutely 10 out of 10 in regards to challenge, adventure, craziness, confidence building etc. I am amazed that one of the three of us did not get seriously injured at sometime in our adventure. Although we failed, I sort of understand how people must feel, not being able to complete a venture like Everest etc.. initially stating that they would never attempt it again and then the next year, there they are.So I guess we'll see.There was a 75 year old, purple haired hippy looking dude who supposedly does the thing 5 times a week and completed it over 800 times. He's in great shape and I guess acts as a guide for hire. So there's hope for me I guess.",Moanalua Middle Ridge
