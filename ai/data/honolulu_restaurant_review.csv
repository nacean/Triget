You do not expect a department store restaurant to make you sit up and take notice, but the meal was outstanding.  The decor is a bit bland, but the staff were great - and again, the meal was delicious.  Mahi Mahi fish tacos - yummy.",Mermaid Bar

23846621,"Just out alone looking for who knows what and... ...for some reason with no intention I stopped here for some take-out.  I ordered a personal-size pizza (I think that's all they make) which I thought was a bit small but still tasty and fresh.  I'm pretty sure they make their own dough but it was a little bit too chewy for me.  I should have ordered it well-done like I usually order pizza.  And I had the Quattro Formaggi Pizza which is all cheese as you would imagine. It had some kind of blue cheese on it which really didn't excite me but still good. You know, even though the pizza was a bit on the small size, and I wish I would've ordered something different, I still want to come back and try this place again.  I guess I sense some kind of good vibe here.",Allegrini Mozzarella

The fried rice (with a variety of sides to choose from), French toast and Barbecue Short Ribs plate were all so yummy!

We will be returning to try more of their entrees!They have a nice inside seating area with open windows :)",Cafe Morey's
2460894,"Taste of Thai In Manoa Valley, on East Manoa Road, just past the marketplace, you will find Bangkok Chef. It is one of several restaurants by the same owner in Honolulu. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly,  and they offer sit down and take out dishes. What's important to me is their on-line presence - the menu is so easy to find and read. One of my favorites dishes, which I have not found it at other Thai restaurants, is their Mango Salad. It's one of the reasons I keep returning. Their Pad Thai, Crispy Noodles, curries are tasty and sizable portions and while I always try other dishes, which are all good, I always seem to come back to ordering these. You can order the dish or ask for it ala carte - one comes with rice and the other without rice. If I have rice at home, ala carte means more tasty food.",Bangkok Chef

2460894,Inedible Just don't eat here. It is gross. The summer rolls have no taste and the peanut sauce tastes just like peanut butter with no modification. The lemongrass chicken did not actually seem much like chicken and made one in our party violently ill afterward. What they call eggplant turns out to be zucchini. I can think of nothing that would make me ever eat here again.,Bangkok Chef

539196,"A bit disappointing  We were staying nearby, and this place was recommended by our hosts, but the food was average at best -- the chicken katsu was a little overcooked and kind of dry -- and more expensive than we had anticipated. We decided what to order based on a menu that must have been *very* old, because the 2-piece side order of chicken katsu had gone from $5.50 to $8.75.",Sam's Delicatessen
539196,"Good Tasting/Generous Portions Korean Food Sam's is one of my usual places for Take out on the way home to Nuuanu.  Its been here for a very long time and I highly recommend calling ahead your order so that you dont need to wait during the lunch/dinner crowd.  This is also the perfect place to order Bento's from (3 order min) for the beach or a picnic.   For Work functions if you spend 75$ or more they will deliver Down town so that's very convenient.  I usually get a mini Barbeque chicken plate which is a generous portion and my boyfriend usually orders the Kal Bi plate $10.95 which is 3 pieces of boneless kalbi.  This is cheap as other places will charge $20 for a Kalbi dinner plate.  They are also known for their Mochiko Chicken which is very good as well.  For $1.20 extra you can get 4 pieces of Mandoo although its not huge mandoo that's a pretty good deal.  IF You order No Rice you will get an extra portion of vegetables.  Parking is located right in front or in the back of the building.  This is NOT a place to eat in, its definitely a hole in the wall but pretty good tasting food and convenient to pick up.  The lady that takes the order is not the friendliest of sorts but is efficient, so speak clearly when placing your order.  Aloha!",Sam's Delicatessen

If you have toured the other various sites within the National Park area, you might be getting rather hungry. If it is also particularly hot on the day you visit, this air-conditioned café, will be an enjoyable respite from the heat. After spending a few hours at park, the boat ride to the memorial, touring the grounds, and both historical indoor exhibits, it was time to visit Ford Island. When we got to the aviation museum, we decided to eat first. An admission ticket is not required for this, nor the gift shop. The menu had more selections this visit, prices weren’t ridiculous, the food was prepared quickly, and it tasted just fine! Granted, the place was not crowded, it was clean, and you have to like it’s 1940’s kitschy island décor. We ordered a variety of items, burgers, hotdogs, pulled pork, fries, chips, sodas, all good. Refreshed, our day continued. If you are eating here later in the day, they often stop serving food closer to closing. Since this is the last stop on the bus route, be mindful when planning a big day. Mahalo",Laniakea Cafe at Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum
8180166,"Disappointed  Having read the reviews and had the cafe advertised on our tour bus, we were underwhelmed by the cafe in general. Three lights were on, making it very dark, as it’s inside the hanger. The staff weren’t friendly or helpful, pushing us to order quickly. They then shut the cooked food part of the cafe at 14:50 when it’s supposed to be open until 16:00 - there was no notice outside to notify visitors of this so multiple people kept coming in asking to be served. They were cleaning around us, making us feel like an inconvenience. The only positive, for giving it 2 star is the food! The fries were fantastic and the toastie and hotdog were done well, however the Caesar salad was very dry. You’re a bit trapped, as you can’t bring bags with you so can’t bring your own food.",Laniakea Cafe at Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum

4369065,"Definitely “No” I really don’t think that anyone goes to a Panda Express and expects an exceptional meal. You obviously get what you pay for, but in Hawaii, especially this location, the portions are small (compared to California) and the taste is bland. 4 different orders and 4 people disappointed. A good indicator would be the lack of people in line as compared to the other nearby food establishments. Avoid the Orange Chicken, Fried Rice, Beef Broccoli, Egg Rolls…in fact, avoid it altogether. The topper…4 meals and we were offered 4 packets of soy sauce and 4 packets of hot mustard. Only good point, soda was good and cold.",Panda Express

Our party of 6 (DH, me, 2 boys ages 8 and 14, grandma and grandpa) stopped by after our tour on the nearby Hawaiian Plantation Village (which I covered in a separate review).We were seated quickly, service was attentive and the food was good.  It's nothing fancy, and apparently we are not the only ones who liken it to Denny's.  It has typical 'American' stuff on offer as well as dishes more typically 'Hawaiian' like loco moco.  I had Portuguese Bean soup and it was very good.  DH had saimin (uniquely Hawaiian noodle soup dish that is their riff on ramen).  He liked it.  The kids and grandparents enjoyed what they got and unlike so many other places we tried, this one didn't break the bank! As far as I'm concerned, this is a win-win all around!",Zippy's Restaurant

434016,"Won’t leave hungry! Traditional Japanese meal in a laid back atmosphere. We were invited by friends to dinner when visiting the area and they suggested Kuni. We each ordered the dinner for two and there was so much food! Everything is served family style and meals include miso soup, Moyashi (bean sprouts),  tsukomona (Pickled cucumbers - my favorite), a lettuce salad with ginger dressing, namasu (A vinegar vegetable salad), Mac salad, and rice. We ordered the rib eye steak, tofu steak, chicken Katsu, shrimp tempura and sashimi. The meats all came sizzling hot. The steak was so tender and flavorful. The tempura shrimp perfectly crispy. The chicken and tofu were so good and the sashimi was delicious. There wasn’t anything we didn’t enjoy. We finished with the Donuts and enjoyed a beer with our meal. This was not just a meal but a whole experience and we enjoyed it! The restaurant is small and seating us first come first seated. As a meal experience takes time to enjoy there isn’t a lot of turn over in tables. We were there nearly 2 hours start to finish and actually closed the place down at 9pm. Once the plates of food start coming they don’t seem to end and it is so good you don’t want to leave anything! Price is great for the experience and quality and quantity of food.",KUNI Restaurant
434016,"Nostalgic charm - local Japanese restaurant and bar Located in the heart of Waipahu in a strip mall off Farrington Highway, this decades old restaurant has been in a time warp with its vinyl booth seating, home style local Japanese foods and ohana atmosphere.   Food is tasty,reasonably priced, and of good portions.  Their specialty is the teishoku combination, allowing you to select between one and three main dishes such as sashimi, misoyaki butterfish, and chicken katsu. If you have room, desserts are a bomb with their ice cream pies, such as watermelon and kona coffee. Come night time and you get complimentary KTV entertainment from the loosely separated Kuni's lounge, which also offers the same menu when the restaurant side is crowded.Most mom-and-pop shops have faded into the sunset with the coming of the national chains.

It comes with rice of course as the starch. I also got 2X sambal chili sauce and chili peppa water. I drive all the way from mililani so might as well get more than just the plate. Prices are reasonable considering the owner is a well established and experienced chef in Oahu. Employee on the phone was pleasant I called to let them know I was coming down for pickup. I went in the restaurant and it's a nice place and I saw Jon there and made small talk with him. He's a cool guy and had a good conversation with him and he got to know my background and I got to know his. I found the feast on YouTube channel ""Where Hawaii eats"" with Anne Lee. I didn't know he had a restaurant but knew he was a chef with the greats of Alan Wong and others. He has a diverse background in the culinary industry. So yeah it was pretty cool talking with him that alone was worth going all the way down to manoa. So I got home and tried the hamburger steak it was very good one of the best I had. The patty was soft and big island local beef which is better than mainland beef and why support mainland conglomerates we should be supporting our local kamaaina establishments here that's our kuleana. The mushroom gravy was awesome best I had it's a dark brown gravy. I could eat that over only rice that's how good it was. Mac salad was good too with plenty flavor.

We love lobster rolls and so often they disappoint.  This was not only the best we have ever had, but we liked it so much we had to order another one.  The place is super casual, walk up, place your order and take a seat.  We enjoyed sitting outside in the beautiful weather while our order was prepared.  Very simple place, because when you have outstanding food, you don't need to mask it with a forced ambience.  We travel to Hawaii as often as we can and this is hands down a place we will ALWAYS be returning to enjoy a meal.  If you understand how expensive lobster is anywhere you will appreciate how fresh, well prepared and authentic these lobster rolls truly are... if you are used to fast food, created in mass for a lower price, this will not be for you.

4498113,"Barely a beverage, mostly ice I've always heard fellow Europeans complain about the American habit of selling a beverage that is mostly ice cubes. I'd never known it was a problem, as an American myself. Usually there are free refills so it's not an issue. However, I suppose there are circumstances where they are right - like today at the mall's food court. No free refills.We got our drink, a Fanta, and it was so good we drank a bit of it before our food was ready. The cup felt so heavy, we thought we had a lot of drink left. Wrong. It was mostly ice - huge ice cubes that don't melt at all, they just fill the cup.I actually had to complain and try to get more beverage. I had to cut in line to do this, very uncomfortable, and I said, ""I'm very thirsty and you gave me a cup of mostly ice."" They replied (2 of them), ""We don't have free refills"" My husband had told me, ""It cannot be called a refill if they don't fill it in the first place, haha."" But I just repeated myself, ""I'm very thirsty and you gave me a cup of mostly ice."" They looked pissed off but they took the cup (against covid regulations, CERTAINLY) and put a bit more beverage in the cup still filled with ice. *sigh* So you Europeans are right afterall, in certain places, Americans will sell you straight up a large beverage filled to the rim with ice, and only a tiny bit of what you paid for. Sad. I hate to be wrong : )",Charleys Cheesesteaks

2309172,"Long Wait for Average Food 40 minutes before we got our food: We arrived at 7 pm to grab takeout and bring it back to our hotel. There was a long line outside and many phoned in orders ahead of us we soon learned.Small crowded kitchen: The kitchen didn't seem equipped to handle the amount of orders they had. One chef and a couple of assistants who were slapping things together. The small grill had fish, chicken, and burgers all crowding the space. Here is where most items get a generous layer of their store bought ""cajun"" seasoning. Average at best: Burritos are more like wraps. The fish was dry/overcooked. My daughter said her burger tasted ""sweet"" so flavor was off and she couldn't eat it. Coleslaw was not cold so I was afraid to eat that. Atmosphere: Young, hip. Lots of young locals and a few tourists.  There is a small amount of seating in a back room that doubles as pantry/storage. Feels like fast food but it takes too long if you don't call in your order.Bottom line: Based on reviews we were excited to try it, but unfortunately we were very disappointed and went to be hungry. If you go maybe try to miss the rush. Perhaps that would produce a better result.",South Shore Grill

I've had dine in and take out from Pho Bistro many times, but I would say it was more for convenience than for the taste. It's good Vietnamese but not my favorite place.

3730235,"""Pho""ggie!!! It's an awesome sandwich, as it should be for $15.25.  They use their own homemade “pho” mayonnaise which tastes great and compliments the Wagyu beef quite well.  You know, I had always been kind of dubious when I saw a restaurant market their beef as Wagyu.  I had this impression Wagyu was imported beef from Japan- that these cows were like fed organic grass grown with purified water and were hand massaged their whole lives by little old Japanese ladies - something obsessive and over the top like that.  I just was reading-up on it, and these breeds of cow are in America too and are quite a big industry.  I thought that restaurants here were not really using Wagyu but just buying some regular beef from Safeway.  The beef here at La Tour is definitely better than any other I've had on a sandwich before.  And you know, the young lady at the counter was quite friendly and helpful when I ordered.  She told me what she likes and dislikes on the menu and what is popular here with other customers.  After I ordered, I walked down to the nearby 7-11 and when I came back, it was ready for pick-up.  I think the service here was exceptional for me.  Glad I tipped them. It was a great late lunch to complement the good day I was having.  Got my third jab/shot earlier, power-walked around Ford Island, and swam a little at Hickam Beach before I came here.

I’ve had ice cream from a similar place in Miami (Taiyaki NYC) so I knew what I was in for here.  SomiSomi has other locations throughout California & Texas, with this as their sole Hawaii location. MENU:Soft serve in four flavors (milk, matcha, ube, Oreo), and four different fillings (Nutella, custard, red bean, taro).  You then choose your serving style:  “Ah-boong” is with the soft serve in the taiyaki cone, “upside down” is the Ah-boong upside down in a cup, or have your ice cream in a cup without the cone. DESSERT:Ah-boong - $5.95The milk-flavored soft serve was your average run-of-the-mill stuff, good, not overly sweet but light on cream flavor.  I got Nutella as a filling which went well with the milk flavor, and rainbow sprinkles which made the dessert look so festive and “happy”.  You also get your choice of macaroon which they stick in the soft serve, which I ended up tossing as I don’t care for them.  Enough sugar!?  The fish-shaped taiyaki cone is soft and chewy, and tastes similar to a waffle cone.  Eating it was a bit messy towards the end as it leaked out of the bottom, though it never got mushy. SERVICE:The gal at the counter was very friendly, patient and welcoming. OVERALL:No DQ?  No problem.",SomiSomi
15632476,"Soft Serve and Taiyaki SomiSomi in Honolulu’s Ala Moana Center is located outside of the lower level food court in the parking area facing Ala Moana Blvd.They sell a soft serve dessert in different flavors (green tea (matcha), Ube (purple yam), milk, Oreo , black sesame...) served in a freshly made fish shaped waffle lined with custard, red bean or Nutella called Ah-Boong. You can have an individual flavor or order one of two swirl combinations offered each week.You then add toppings... fruity pebbles, Oreo crumbles.... finally,  top it off with a macaroon or a strawberry.",SomiSomi
2251830,"Looked better than it tasted Stopped here for lunch after visiting Lyon's arboretum, but our onion rings were weirdly mushy.  Not the outside which was nicely battered, but the actual onion had no structure, it was just mush and no flavor.  Sorry, but not delicious.",Island Subs & Burgers
2251830,"Damn good! Impressive  Good service great subs, don’t like the .75 refill policy but ok whatever. Decent sub shop reminiscent of some places I know in upstate New York.  I seen the burgers, can’t vouch for the taste but the 1 pound burger is huge!!! Beats out any chain on the island by price.  My philly was spot on. Needed a little salt and mayo but pretty good.",Island Subs & Burgers
2251830,Great Sandwiches!!! Great food and excellent service!!!  Their sub sandwiches are grilled and tasty with fries and onion rings!  Their hot dogs and hamburgers are good too!  I never have to wait very long for my order and I’m a walk in.  I highly recommend this place!,Island Subs & Burgers
2273528,"Yummy Pizza Easy online ordering with lots of options to choose from. We picked it up because we use the 5050 code which gets people over 50, 50% off of their pizza. No sides this time, but we'll be back for more another day. The kids love the dessert options we've had in the past. IMO The brownie is really good and dad loves The Works pizza.",Papa Johns Pizza
2273528,"Manager Was Ideal I have not actually tried the food, yet. However, I wanted to leave this review because the manager went above and beyond to correct a problem with my order. I placed the order online. When I arrived sometime later, I saw that I had an extra charge.  Apparently, somehow, I had added extra beef and extra chicken to my large three topping pizza. I did not want chicken nor beef. When I clarified this for the manager, he offered to redo the pizza for me. I told him that this was not necessary. But he insisted. He states that it was his job to make sure that I was happy as the customer. Coming from this manager, I believe it to be an authentic statement. He was  friendly, professional, patient, and understanding. I observed him interacting with his staff and he appears to be someone they take seriously and respect. Just on the interaction with the manager, I would recommend this place. Mahalo nui loa, Bilal!",Papa Johns Pizza
2273528,So so pizza Well it's not as good as I was expecting.  They didn't put a lot of topping of what I wanted.  Just so so pizza. I was hungry so it tasted good but nothing spectacular.  The customer service was good. I actually went to the Kalihi store. I might try again. Was looking for a healthy pizza. When are you going to start using whole wheat flour to make your pizza?  I wouldn't really recommend this place.,Papa Johns Pizza
434468,It's just okay What used to be one of my favorite Chinese restaurants is now not because of the waitstaff. They are indifferent and unfriendly.  Used to look forward to kau yuk with taro. I will find another restaurant with better personnel.,Wah Kung Restaurant
434468,"Favorite Chinese I'm not a big fan of Chinese food in general, but Wah Kung would have to be my favorite. For my taste, Chinese food can be a bit on the bland side and sometimes oily. But the food at Wah Kung is tastier and i actually make the drive here to eat, which says a lot because I don't like to drive anywhere far to eat unless it's worth it.",Wah Kung Restaurant
434468,New owners If u were used to the previous restaurant menu and portion size...this is not the same.   That being said.  The food is good and although the portion size is a tad smaller it is still enough food to make u full. The curry brisket is very tasty and all of the sauces in the dishes are outstanding. Will go back again.,Wah Kung Restaurant

434002,"Mo better elsewhere The bread is fantastic the rest is just ok.  They are very stingy with the middle part of the sandwich.   Prices are high for a sandwich but would be acceptable qif they actually put some meat, cheese and condiments on the bread.  Subway would be better and I hate Subway.",Paradise Cafe

Bacon in the omelets are full strips, no big deal for us, just different.  Crab and avocado    omlette was well worth the price!",Bogart's Cafe

5244546,"Terrible Service at this location Terrible Service!!!! Wanted to try the food but the owner did not want to serve us. She preferred to serve dogs (not service dogs) instead of an African American family with a child. We were seated and about to order when a couple of white Americans brought their dog and sat it in the chair next to us. The dog was just on the floor and now in a chair. It was not a service animal but the “manager” winked at them to lie and say it was. We saw you.  So we had to leave.  Unacceptable! The manager was a liar, showed racist tendencies and unprofessional.  I also own a dog so that was not the issue.",Alejandro's Mexican Food
5244546,"Mexican food at its finest We found this restaurant on our first trip to Hawaii and we have been coming back for more ever since! The food is always hot, fresh and so tasty.The food is very inexpensive. I always get the 12"" steak burrito with red sauce. Make sure you ask for the red hot salsa to put on top.Great food, walk up ordering and fast pick up.",Alejandro's Mexican Food
